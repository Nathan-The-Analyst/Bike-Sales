# Bike-Sales


Through this project, I harnessed the power of Ms-Excel to transform bike sales data into valuable business insights.

The Process Involved:

Data Cleaning: I meticulously cleaned the survey data to ensure its accuracy and consistency, preparing it for further analysis.

Data Exploration: Leveraging Ms-Excel, I conducted a thorough exploration of the cleaned data to identify key trends and patterns.

Data Visualization: I created clear data visualizations within Ms-Excel to effectively communicate the discovered insights.
